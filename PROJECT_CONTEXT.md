Project: HRC 2026 Robotics Competition

Architecture:
- Mac: development machine (coding, planning, lightweight testing)
- Linux: runtime machine (simulation, evaluation, dataset, logs)

Core Workflow:
- Code is written on Mac
- Code is synced via Git
- Code is executed only on Linux
- Results are analyzed and iteration continues on Mac

Rules:
- Never run heavy simulation on Mac
- Never store dataset, checkpoints, or outputs in Git
- Always use environment variables for paths (no hardcoded local paths)
- Keep code minimal, modular, and testable
- Prioritize stability before optimization

Environment:
- Linux uses environment variables:
  HRC_ROOT, HRC_REPO, DATA_ROOT, CKPT_ROOT, OUTPUT_ROOT, LOG_ROOT
- Code must run on both Mac and Linux without modification

Development Strategy:
- Build baseline first (deterministic pipeline)
- Avoid premature optimization
- Avoid large refactors without benchmark evidence

Current Focus:
- Phase: Infrastructure + baseline setup
- Goal: build minimal pipeline for Task 1
- No learning-based methods yet (IL/ACT later)

Assumptions:
- Dataset not fully available yet
- Simulator not fully set up yet
- Focus is on reproducible pipeline, not performance
